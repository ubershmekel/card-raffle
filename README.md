# WebCard

[Check it out...](https://ubershmekel.github.io/webcard/?background=%2324292e&color=%23fff&fontSize=3vw&text=You%20came%20here%20from%20github%3F%0AScroll%20down...)

The URL defines what shows up in the card, you can edit the contents in the form beneath the card.

The reason for this is I don't want to print business cards. Instead, I have a shortcut on my phone that shows my email address. Anyone who asks for a card can pull out their phone and snap a picture of that WebCard.

I've also used WebCard as a colorful way to attract attention to a screen, or just to send random messages to people.

Let me know what you do with it.

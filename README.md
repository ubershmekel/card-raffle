# WebCard

The URL defines what shows up in the card, you can edit the contents in the form beneath the card.

The reason for this is I don't want to print business cards. Instead, I have a shortcut on my phone that shows my email address. Anyone who asks for a card can pull out their phone and snap a picture of that WebCard.

I've also used WebCard as a colorful way to attract attention to a screen, or just to send random messages to people.

Let me know what you do with it.
